# TyTalk

A basic chat client using Node.js.

## Running

First, go to the server directory, and run "run.bat". This runs the server.js file with node.

Next up, go to the client directory, and run that run.bat file. This starts the HTTP server with Python.

Finally, go to http://localhost:8000 and chat away!
